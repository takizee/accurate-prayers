Google Calendar Addon to create and updates prayer times events to help muslims organize their day using the Time Blocking technique.

> Time blocking is a time management method that asks you to divide your day into blocks of time. Each block is dedicated to accomplishing a specific task, or group of tasks, and only those specific tasks. Instead of keeping an open-ended to-do list of things you’ll get to as you’re able, you’ll start each day with a concrete schedule that lays out what you’ll work on and when.

# Concept
The idea behind this time management technique is to organize your productivity sessions so that each session begins and ends with a prayer.

# Day Structure
The day is structured as time blocks between prayers (Fard and sunnah) 

1- after fajr -> duha [ 3 hours on average depending on when you're going to pray duha]

2- duha -> dhuhr [ 3 hours ]

3- dhuhr -> asr [ 3 hours ]

4- asr ->maghrib [3 hours ]

5- maghrib -> isha [ 1 hour ]

6- isha -> witr [ 2 hours ]


Note that the duration of each block is not fixed as prayer times changes , blocks will be shorter in winter than summer.
